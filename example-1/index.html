			<p>Hi, my name is Chell! </p>
			<br/>
			<p> I am a beautiful tortie/calico/tabby cat. I have been named Peoples choice of the household since the day I blessed this home.</p>
			<br/>
			<p> However, I am not happy. And why would such a beautiful cat like me not be happy. Well I have the answer.</p>
			<br/><strong>THE DOG.</strong></p>
			<br/>
			<p>Ever since my mom brought home the dog (named Leela) life has been subpar. The dog always wants to smell things, play, and be a good girl overall. Honestly how lame! Also I've caught her I few times trying to eat from the litter box. Disgusting!</p>
			<br/>
			<p>So I created this site to celebrate how wonderful cats are, and how dogs are not wonderful.</p>
